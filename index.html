    <p "font-size: 26px>
      Hi! I'm Radwan Jama (RJ) born and raised in Columbus, Ohio . I am currently studying Computer Science at Colgate University, and I am thrilled to be a finalist for the Salesforce FTL program. I would be mainly interested in working on projects that can come to creating an impact on disadvantaged communities and using programming as a tool to enact change. </p>
        
       <p> During my time at Colgate I aim to be heavily active on my campus. Currently I am the Treasurer of Brothers: a non-greek fraternal organization dedicated to improving the experiences of men of color on Colgate's Campus. This allows for me to have a mentorship role to fellow men of color. I also participated as a Volunteer Income Tax Assistant in which I was able to file taxes for low income families around Madison County in Hamilton NY. This experience showed me that even though I was able to make it out of cyclical poverty and beat the odds, that is not the reality for most individuals. This experience exacerbated my desire to give back. Ultimately this is why I eventually want to go back to Columbus, and promote STEM opportunities for students like myself. Whose potential was overlooked growing up mainly because of their social economic status.</p>
