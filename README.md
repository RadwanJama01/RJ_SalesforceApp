## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the user‚Äôs experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
* 
I would try implementing a text to speech aspect to the website that allows for people that are either dyslexic or have a hard time seeig the screen to have something that reads the about section to the user.

* * Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?
    
It is important because it allows for the work one produces to affect a wider group of people than it would have if it was not implemeneted. I the alt image feature because it allows for people that are not able to see my photos to be able to have a description of the image. Although descriptions are not as optimal as images I believe the attempt to convey the information in the webpage is just as important.
